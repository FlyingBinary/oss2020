We need to learn what researchers are creating and the researching need feedback on what they should be looking for.
What Kim will go into LINDDUN GO (https://www.linddun.org/go) as a way to look into privacy related threats. She will also discuss how to use LINDDUN GO and will be asking for feedback from the community. Koen will present his paper on DFD and a paper on maturity of threat modeling.</description></item><item><title>Cloud based threat models</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/cloud-based-threat-models/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/cloud-based-threat-models/</guid><description/></item><item><title>COVID Apps Threat Modeling</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/covid-apps-threat-modeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/covid-apps-threat-modeling/</guid><description>Description Covid-19 apps threat modeling session is a discussion on contact tracing mobile applications.

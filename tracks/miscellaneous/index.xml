Creating something simple is very difficult (&amp;hellip;)
Overthinking/Over-engineering How do you define it? Does one follow another? Where does OT/OE end and becomes a requirement? Can OT/OE be a side-effect caused by something else? i.e. Lack of experience. i.e. would you still choose starting with micro-services or plan for a may-not-be-needed distributed structure. Lack of visibility on business goals, projects etc Not able to keep up with ever growing buzzwords and products Not able to define and understand not-so-technical concepts like bottlenecks or constraints, so fail to see/prevent them.</description></item><item><title>Post-mortem for the Security Incident Exercise we did - what are the outcomes</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/post-mortem-for-the-security-incident-exercise-we-did-what-are-the-outcomes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/post-mortem-for-the-security-incident-exercise-we-did-what-are-the-outcomes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Secure it at the source - Node.JS, GO, Rust, etc make it easy and secure in the framework</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/secure-it-at-the-source-nodejs-go-rust-etc-make-it-easy-and-secure-in-the-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/secure-it-at-the-source-nodejs-go-rust-etc-make-it-easy-and-secure-in-the-framework/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Secure it at the source, frameworks and how to get them more secure</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/secure-it-at-the-source-frameworks-and-how-to-get-them-more-secure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/secure-it-at-the-source-frameworks-and-how-to-get-them-more-secure/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sense making with Cynefin framework</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/sense-making-with-cynefin-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/sense-making-with-cynefin-framework/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Topologies for Security</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/team-topologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/team-topologies/</guid><description>There will be two short presentations, one by Manuel Pais and another one by Mario Platt, followed by a discussion with everyone on the topics presented.
Manuel: The ratio of developers to security is 1:100 or worse, according to multiple surveys. DevSecOps has raised the profile of security in IT but we still see a regular stream of serious data breaches exposing large security gaps in many organizations.
You might have heard a lot about shift left security, automated security testing in the delivery pipeline, container image scanning, and so on.</description></item></channel></rss>
